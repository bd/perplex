perplex
=======

The Perplex is an experiment in quasi-linguistic formalism, in gibberish. Borrowing and inverting techniques from computer science and analytic linguistics, it blindly strives to produce the outer appearance of language--to be all form and no content. The Perplex produces synthetic languages, or at least their syntactic forms, by writing letters to you. The production of the text and the production of a given language are interdependent. 

Like most of my work, this is a serious joke. A lonely robot, desperately seeking to communicate in an unending series of idiolects, or a play on the abstract aesthetics of non-representational painting for a conceptual artist. And, like most of my work, it is a point on a line, or a member of a set--these examples are not the first, nor will they be the last iterations of the attempt to make excellent gibberish.

I'd like to thank Helen Thorington and Jo-Anne Green of  [Turbulence.org](http://turbulence.org), and the [NEA](arts.gov) for helping to make this project possible, not to mention the inspiration and guidance provided by Andrew McNay, and Andrew Wilson, among many others.
